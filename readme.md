# Auction House

![image](auctionhouse.png)

This is a semester project for Noroff. This is an auction site with simple functionality. My delivery was resit, and it was delivered late because of some unfortunate situations in my life. Therefore this delivery is far from my best, but has the instructed functionality as of user stories in the brief.

## Description

This project was a simple Auction House. It has bid functionality and auth functionality from the Noroff API.
It is built with vanilla javascript to prove to someone that vanilla JS still has a place in the world. You can log in and register with the auth api. You can also create, edit and delete your own listings if logged in. Also you can click in on a single auction and see the current bids, and who is selling what. 

If you have the highest bid when time runs out, you win the auction. 

The design is a bit too simple, and could need a overhaul. Let me know if you want to help.
