## Instructions
This is a semester project for Noroff. This is an auction site with simple functionality. My delivery was resit, and it was delivered late because of some unfortunate situations in my life. Therefore this delivery is far from my best, but has the instructed functionality as of user stories in the brief.

## Running the project
npm install to install.

npm run dev will live-server and build css --watch.
